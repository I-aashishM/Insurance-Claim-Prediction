# Insurance-Claim-Prediction

##### 1. Objective:  To create a model that accurately predicts the value of insurance claims using specific user data.

##### 2. Data Used: Features such as age, gender, smoking status, number of children, and diabetic status are included, with the target variable being the claim amount.

##### 3. Data Preparation: Steps include addressing missing values, transforming categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

##### 4. Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand how different features distribute and their relationships with the target variable.

##### 5. Choosing Features: Selection of key features that impact the prediction accuracy.

##### 6. Model Development and Training: Employ regression techniques like linear regression and decision tree regression, training them on a divided dataset.

##### 7. Assessing Model: Utilizing metrics like MAE, MSE, and RMSE to evaluate model accuracy.

##### 8. Optimizing Model: Refinement of the model through hyperparameter adjustments to enhance its performance.

##### 9. Implementation: Rolling out the model for operational use in estimating new claims.

##### 10. Impact on Business: The model is designed to help the insurance company with precise predictions of potential claim amounts, facilitating better financial and resource management. It recommends ongoing assessment and enhancement of the model, noting it predicts continuous values, unlike binary outcomes.
